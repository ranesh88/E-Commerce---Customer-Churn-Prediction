# E-Commerce---Customer-Churn-Prediction
Churn prediction is a critical aspect for businesses across various industries, enabling them to anticipate and mitigate customer attrition effectively. In this project we will cover how to build accurate churn prediction models using machine learning algorithms.

Why Churn Prediction Matters:

Churn prediction isn't just about retaining customers â€“ it's about fostering long-term relationships, driving profitability, and sustaining business success. By harnessing the predictive capabilities of machine learning, organisations can anticipate churn triggers, personalise retention efforts, and ultimately strengthen their competitive edge in the market.

Topics Covered:

- Introduction to Churn Prediction: Understanding what churn is and why it matters to businesses.
- 
- Data Preparation: Preparing the data for analysis, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalisation.
- 
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights from the data through visualization and statistical analysis.
- 
- Building Machine Learning Models: Implementing predictive model as Gradient Boosting Machines.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimising model performance through hyperparameter tuning techniques.
